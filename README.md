# YTDLP

<p>TRG presents a YT-DLP wrapper written for Java. This wrapper controls [YT-DLP](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), which allows you to rapidly download files from YouTube and other sites.</p> 
<p>This wrapper was written for use in archival projects so as to prevent the global censorship / deplatforming issue.</p>
<p>Be aware that this program, as well as YT-DLP will be controversial. Make sure that you know the laws in your country, what you're doing and how to avoid abusing YouTube.</p>
